## About me

I am passionate about programming and enjoy exploring different technologies. Currently, I have experience in the following languages and tools:

- Java with Spring Boot
- PHP with Laravel
- Management of database managers such as SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL and phpMyAdmin.

Although I consider my knowledge of these languages to be basic, I have worked on several projects, including some carried out during my university courses, where I have implemented CRUD operations and other functionalities.

I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a developer. If you have any interesting projects or just want to chat about programming, don't hesitate to contact me!

Thank you for visiting my profile!
